                Throughout my four years at UC Berkeley, I have worked at many different organizations and even started my own -

              <p> At gofind.ai, I helped develop their license plate detection application. The first portion of my work was building
                the detection model, and the second part was building the character recognition script. The detection model was built using YOLOV2 in tensorflow
                and would detect bounding boxes of license plates in images and videos of cars. The character recognition script would then take in 
                the license plates found in the detection model and output a text file with the license plate numbers. I also solely
                worked on the design and wireframing of the application.

              <p> I collaborated with a development team of four to collect, filter, transform, and analyze over twenty hours of 
                streamed video data from Kiwi Robots in order to help the robots navigate crosswalks autonomously. My project was to
                predict steering wheel and throttle of the delivery robots by implementing the Stanford paper, <a href = 'http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/626.pdf'> <i>Self-Driving Car Steering Angle Prediction Based on Image Recognition</i></a>,
                on the data my team collected. Following the paper, I built two different models in PyTorch. The first model comprised of 3D convolutional layers followed by LSTM recurrent layers. The second model used transfer learning with 2D convolutional 
                layers on a pre-trained model where I only retrained the fully connected layers.

                on a virtual map to help Lime choose which areas to expand too and increase bike capacity. You can check out the clustering <a href="\data\clustering.png">here</a>!<i>&nbsp; Utilized Python, Pandas, OpenCV, Sci-Kit Learn. </i>

              <p> I started Diascan in the summer of 2015. Diascan was a software that used deep learning and computer vision to help radiologists more accurately 
                detect and diagnose lung cancer from medical imagery. As the technology lead, I built the machine learning pipeline. The pipeline had two parts. The first
                part was a SSD object detection model that would return bounding boxes of tumors found in  CT scans. The second part of the pipeline was a 
                classification model that would classify whether or not the tumor found in the first part of the pipeline was benign or malignant.
